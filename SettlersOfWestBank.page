Inspired by Settlers of Catan. Also politically incorrect.
* Goal: to settle on more land than the other players
* Resources are known as “US aid”
* The map grid begins occupied by Palestinians
* Palestinians can be removed by being surrounded by blockades or by airstrikes
* Airstrikes may result in UN resolutions
* Cards: holocaust, Gaza rocket, white phosphorus
* UN resolutions can be countered by playing the holocaust card
* Gaza rocket deals minor damage but increases US aid
* White phosphorus “cleanses” 4 adjacent tiles
