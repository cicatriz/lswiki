## Tricki

Tricki, brought to you by Fields Medalists Timothy Gowers and Terence Tao, is

a brand new Wiki-style site that is intended to develop into a large store of useful mathematical problem-solving techniques.
It’s generally at the level of undergraduate and up.

The front page does a good job of outlining what’s currently available. Here’s an example of a well-developed article on something in an intro analysis class, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. It’s quite dense, so I’d have to wait for more concentration and motivation to get through it.

Seems like it could be very useful.
