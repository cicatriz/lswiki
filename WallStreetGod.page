God chooses a prophet. However, God makes the wrong choice, and now he’s stuck with him. The prophet accepts it readily, no hesitation. He’s going to use this opportunity come out on top. Also he never learns the error of his ways. I’m tired of all these anti-heroes who go around becoming reformed. I want an opportunist motherfucker, through and through being given an unimaginable power. I want him to go around screaming, "Behold I am the hand of God, and if you want to kiss it, suck my cock."
Me:
There’s enough to answer just in the background to keep a whole season packed.

* what was his job?
* what was his prior belief?
* how was he conceived?
* how is he informed?
* how are others informed?

If we assume his position is widely known and believed, then he would have such radical powers of altering the world that we can hardly take anything we know for granted. Or maybe most people would try to continue their lives as normally as possible. Jesus Inc just manifests as another giant corporation that sells mandates rather than products and services. I keep thinking of the prophet as a previous businessman.
I’m surprised I can’t think of any fictionalizations of modern-day prophets. I’m sure they’re out there, but maybe not with this slant.
Former Wall Streeter is perfect actually.
