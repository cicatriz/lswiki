Not sure if the title of this page is descriptive enough... I mean for the page to be a collection of high-level design features, focused on how the site would have to be structured (not on the low-level mechanics of how the user interacts with a particular part of the design).


## Combining Faded examples with community collaboration

Faded examples are good for individual study; demonstrated effectiveness.

To combine with collaboration features, I'm thinking the following:

If a student doesn't understand a certain step, or thinks there is a different high-level concept which would be equivalent/better, then they can flag a particular problem and/or step for the community and/or TA's. This then auto-creates a discussion pad similar to openstudy (or even at open study...?), where community members can weigh in.

We could also implement something a la stack exchange, where community members with enough street cred have limited admin powers to augment worked examples by showing alternative methods?
