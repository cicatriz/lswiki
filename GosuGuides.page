I’m not quite sure how to pitch this. Our medium is the blog, and our goal is to make “Gosu Guides” to various things. The idea stems from enjoyment of the analysis of how things work and discussion of “solving” all kinds of things.
 
First imagine games: video games, card games, etc. We approach things with a strong AI/applied math/game theory/neuroscience perspective. We provide such things as analysis of the patterns of the game, algorithms or formulas for enhancing your play, and effective methods of practicing and learning (the neuroscience part). This of course ties into our other e-learning project ideas, and may lead to some interesting AI or math results down the road. The question is how good we’d actually be at doing this, and whether anyone would want to read it. I’m optimistic, given enough dedication.
 
I think a niche will enjoy this strongly analytic approach, and we can attempt to broaded our topics to popular things, like diet and fitness for one. That could eventually lead to revenue from adversting/ebooks/consulting/real books. But do it for passion first.
