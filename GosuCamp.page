The PROMYS head counselor is here with me in Utah. It sounds like a really cool job, but for various reasons I probably wouldn’t ever do it there. But I think there’s always room for more programs to educate and mentor people. Obviously, we don’t have nearly enough financial resources to start something like that at the moment (though maybe it’d be worth talking to some faculty at one of our colleges — I guess other than BU), but I’m wondering about the potential for a similar program online.
 
So I’m envisioning that if this summer is extremely successful, we could have a very nice C2T app, and when Google Wave comes out, we can implement that as the final touch for student/teacher interaction and whatever else. But, as I’ve seen over and over, we need to act very fast before lots of similar things pop up. So we need something really cool to show off our app, rather than having it sit idlely while we wait for busy, underpaid teachers to throw content at it with little chance of payout.
 
One idea is to do have Alabama ARML (or general problem solving in the meantime) training. Some of the kids who went with Grissom sound really enthusiastic, and we could possibly ask for partnership with Mathew Crawford. Though it might mean less face-time teaching (= big money) for him.
