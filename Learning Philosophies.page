## From Scott H. Young's eBook: Summary of Holistic Learning

> Although I’ve gone through many ideas, if there is one takeaway idea it is that you should be creating vast webs of interlinked ideas rather than pounding information into your skull. Not only is this a more effective form of learning it is more enjoyable. Visceralizing and using metaphors is fun. Instead of learning a dry subject and trying to force your brain to store it, you are using your mind the way it was intended.

> If I’ve allowed one student to study less in order to know his subject or given one of you the means to improve her understanding, I’ve reached my goal. I absolutely hate having to resort to excuses of talent or giftedness to explain skills. Hopefully I’ve done a small part in breaking down the intellectual elitism and giving hardworking people a chance to use the skills others take for granted.

## Random stuff from wave

* importance of modeling in learning (modeling someone who knows what they're doing)- use live streaming?
* for most things, i can just google rather than keeping references
* Meno's paradox: http://www.aarweb.org/syllabus/syllabi/c/cohen/phil320/menopar.htm
* why does categorizing things help
* narrowing down the range of the problem helped solve it sometime allows the brain figure it out almost instantly
* how to give hints; hints before and after the "wall of understanding"
* pattern recognition
* listing out examples is very helpful ex: 'ab' & 'ba' DFA thing
* big/abstract patterns same as small/easy patterns?
* big patterns: blink
* memorization is important for pattern recognition, presumably
* consciousness: goertzel, the self as another pattern to recognize
* How much time to develop good intuition on something? probably proportional to complexity. Ex: what's the complexity for poker? 52C2 starting hands..

## Lockhart's Lament

http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_03_08.html - necessary (but not sufficient?) idea for education of math and other subjects -- must be made interesting by showing the underlying beauty, not just algorithms and facts

## Peer Instruction

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwslBPj8GgI Students don't really learn stuff; they just memorize it for a while. Solution from Prof. Mazur: teach concepts instead of formula-based questions. Quiz students throughout lecture, and let them discuss with each other. 

Lesson for Learnstream: the way we make questions; chat features for students; sync cards back to chat logs?

From http://tech.mit.edu/V130/N49/normandin.html 

> This was one of the failures of lecture-based freshman physics. For most students, they’d never had to utilize “expert” techniques during high school. The formulas were all they needed. As a result, lectures that professors delivered which seemed clear and carefully thought out were perceived in an entirely different light by their students, who had yet to develop the problem-solving skills and advanced reasoning that the lecturer took for granted. Research supports this; Wieman points out that it has been shown that even when looking at a simulation on a computer screen, students “literally see different things happening… than do the experts. As a result, the student can interpret what is shown very differently from what was intended, and learn incorrect ideas.”
