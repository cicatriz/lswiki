Key Concepts
 
 
Forced positions:
long vertical block: must be at bottom
two small vertical blocks: top block must be at top
 
difficulty of modeling with 'temporal element' -- must unblock car in current position, only then can unblock in later position 
 
Reaction post
 
many puzzles done without much conscious effort - just try to find a 'non-trivial' move (one that opens more possibilities)
at first, conscious thought sometimes incorrectly deemed something impossible. this got better over time.
