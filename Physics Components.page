Comments from Theresa Lynn, April 22nd

She's happy to answer specific questions when they arise/provide materials... but doesn't have the precise vision and so wasn't sure she could give helpful general feedback.

As to what freshmen are lacking....

Math skills:
Trigonometry
Algebra
Vectors
taking components in particular; addition, subtraction, dot/cross products, etc.

Generally speaking: a student will come into office hours, you'll put a problem up on the board, and it will take them a /long/ time to do some simple trig/algebraic or vector manipulation. They simply aren't fluent, and have a hard time deciding what to do. A story from AE tutoring today: I was helping someone find the tension in a hanging rope. We got to an equation based on a FBD of a thin slice in the rope, and the equation was just the definition of the derivative from calculus (the iconic form!!). I asked her if this rang any bells from calculus... she stared for a while, then had to look through a note sheet in a notebook she was carrying before eventually finding it. She thanked me for not telling her the answer, but i feel that is something that everyone should recognize immediately.

Physics Concepts:
Newton's third law -- half of students at end of semester still don't understand this
Centripetal acceleration -- don't understand it is towards the center (problem with vectors..?)
Force concept inventory questions
1d, 2d kinematics are more or less assumed knowledge -- treat them in Phys24 at a theoretical level, but move very quickly and assume students have seen this in high school and are comfortable with such problems.

Math/Physics:
Centers of Mass
Moments of Inertia
Have a hard time setting up the integrals.
Have a hard time going from word descriptions to a mathematical description. What variables do we need? What is given? What are we trying to find?

GENERAL:
Being good with vectors
Knowing the "tricks" of the trade -- talk to Prof. Sparks
Example: when to use a sin or a cos? Answer: DONT draw out the triangle and geometer your way to the answer...
Meta-cognitive questions -- what type of problem is this? what types of principles should I apply?
Setting expectations: Good study habits and techniques, etc.
Example: student who was shocked (in a non-physics class) when they did poorly on a midterm after studying stuff in the book -- the exam covered the material emphasized in class.

Department's thoughts about physics SI class:
words --> math (choosing variables, etc.)
Fermi estimation problems

To look into: Giancoli Textbook: http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_giancoli_physicsppa_6/

Look at physics placement test (talk to townsend/kathy) to see what types of problems it has
Lynn estimated about 11-12 (of 36?) were math-related questions
