A college student has a sudden epiphany about his life after realizing the amount of student loans he will have as an Art major. He turns to selling drugs; however, he’s not going for dime bags, he wants to become the next Frank Lucas. Swallowed by his new ambition he starts weaving his web. We can have Biggie’s the Ten Crack Commandments as our intro.

Think of Weeds, except less comedy.
