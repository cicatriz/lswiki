[Future of Science]()

Tom Wujec - visual collaboration for business 

blog vs twitter

* blog: periodic review, "deep" questions i have, predictions, reflection on what i found out <-- blog as scientific method
* twitter: random thoughts, may not lead to anything; ask quick questions; propagate links <-- twitter as "real" scientific work
* blog or twitter as expert system: e.g. someone watches cctv少儿 constantly, has chinese culture and child psychology background, makes observations and commentary
* future of education: hypercrossspecialization for individuals, each keeps blog/twitter/whatever, networks of related items, AI systems to process
* current problem: too many people talking about the same shit
