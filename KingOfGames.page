This is an idea I have for a reality show that puts people through random, unique games that test people’s ability to form strategy on the spot and psychologically analyze their opponents. This mostly influenced by love of shows like Gossip Girl and comics such as Kaiji.
The games will have rules, but only a few of the rules will be strict. In fact, players will be tacitly encouraged to cheat. Nothing filmed on camera will be considered being caught. Instead rules will be enforced by game referees on the floor, who will in general take a Lassiez Faire approach to their job. This will allow players to take multiple playing styles and be creative in their problem solving.
Ideally, we would start each player off with a certain amount of cash and allow them to carry it over into their next round. So there’s a cumulative benefit to doing well. Plus, varying starting positions will force people to adjust strategies and will hopefully help break stalemates.

## Game 1
Heads-up challenge. Put 2 people in a room and give them a certain amount of time.  You can only progress if you end with more money than you started with. This game will essentially test people’s creative problem solving for what would otherwise be a perfect stalemate.

## Game 2
Primary election. You and your opponents are running for office. Rounds consist of voting for whoever you want to become elected. Votes can be sold and bought from other players.  Also, perfect contracts exist i.e. one place where cheating won’t be allowed. At the end, the chosen president will himself be able to choose who to eliminate from the competition.
