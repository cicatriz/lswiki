# Welcome to the Learnstream Wiki

This wiki is where we are collecting our thoughts related to our goals with [Learnstream](Front Page#learnstream) and [other projects](Front Page#other-projects). Broadly, our goal is to make the world a better place, with a primary focus using well [designed](Design) technology to [learn](Learning) and [be productive](Productivity).

## To do

Improve structure, clean up pages. The goals should be making it possible to comprehend everything that exists here and to be able to quickly locate things or add things in a reasonable place.

### Transfered so far
* Learnstream-Dev Google Group (by Ryan)
* LS Dev course on Learnstream Beta (by Ryan)
* PBWorks wiki (by Neal)
* Blog

### Need to transfer
* Google Docs
* Twitter
* Google Reader shares/other interesting shared articles
* Dropbox Research

## Guidelines 

* What to use wiki for: It should be an encyclopedia of knowledge relevant to our project including but not limited to ideas for development and content, understanding about learning and related topics, and information relevant to potential business/distribution models 
* What to use Google docs for: drafting and storing letters and forms for external use, spreadsheets with usable content, blog posts ...
* What to use mailing list for: getting out ideas initially for discussion. Please get important stuff into wiki or Docs ASAP!!
* What to use blog for: push out interesting articles extracted from our discussion and wiki. Don't draft new ideas in the blog and disregard all of the other steps. You should draft the post in Google Docs anyways, as WordPress has a shitty editor (imho).
* What to use (other thing) for: DON'T!!!! Four is enough.
