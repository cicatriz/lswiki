# Welcome to the Learnstream Wiki

## To do

Improve structure, clean up pages. The goals should be making it possible to comprehend everything that exists here and to be able to quickly locate things or add things in a reasonable place.

## Guidelines 

* What to use wiki for: It should be an encyclopedia of knowledge relevant to our project including but not limited to ideas for development and content, understanding about learning and related topics, and information relevant to potential business/distribution models 
* What to use Google docs for: drafting and storing letters and forms for external use, spreadsheets with usable content, ...
* What to use mailing list for: getting out ideas initially for discussion. Please get important stuff into wiki or Docs ASAP!!
* What to use blog for: push out interesting articles extracted from our discussion and wiki. Don't draft new ideas in the blog and disregard all of the other steps.
* What to use (other thing) for: DON'T!!!! Four is enough.
