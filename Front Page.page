# Welcome to the Learnstream Wiki

This wiki is where we are collecting our thoughts related to our goals with [Learnstream](Front Page#learnstream) and [other projects](Front Page#other-projects). Broadly, our goal is to make the world a better place, with a primary focus using well [designed](Design) technology to [learn](Learning) and [be productive](Productivity).

## To do

* Go through [unsorted references](Front Page#unsorted) and Learnstream "loose ends"
* Organize [other projects](Front Page#other-projects) better -- _partially done_
* Create summary/starting point pages (both in case others join the party and for ourselves to get a handle on everything)
* Convert discussions/monologues into more wiki-pages unless the discussion is particularly worth saving. Examples: [Khan Academy]() [Competition Response]() [Spaced Repetition and Memory]() [Heisig Method]() [Flipped Classroom]()
* Finish transferring 
* Figure out web hosting

### Transfered so far

* Learnstream-Dev Google Group (by Ryan)
* LS Dev course on Learnstream Beta (by Ryan)
* PBWorks wiki (by Neal)
* Blog

### Need to transfer

* Google Docs
* Twitter
* Google Reader shares/other interesting shared articles
* Dropbox Research

## Guidelines 

### What do I use _____ for?

* What to use wiki for: It should be an encyclopedia of knowledge relevant to our project including but not limited to ideas for development and content, understanding about learning and related topics, and information relevant to potential business/distribution models 
* What to use Google docs for: drafting and storing letters and forms for external use, spreadsheets with usable content, blog posts ...
* What to use mailing list for: getting out ideas initially for discussion. Please get important stuff into wiki or Docs ASAP!!
* What to use blog for: push out interesting articles extracted from our discussion and wiki. Don't draft new ideas in the blog and disregard all of the other steps. You should draft the post in Google Docs anyways, as WordPress has a shitty editor (imho).
* What to use (other thing) for: DON'T!!!! Four is enough.

### How to use the wiki

* See also: [Help]()
* Try to avoid first-person, especially without saying who that person is
* Remember that this is public
* Keep it simple stupid; when in doubt throw it out
* REMEMBER TO PUSH!
