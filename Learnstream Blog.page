## The best education is no education

time_ago_in_words I was completing the research ethics education required for my PhD program. It's one of those that give you a section of reading followed by a quiz (and repeat a couple dozen times). Given my recent interest in training education, I was trying to think of what could make it more engaging and also transfer better to the day-to-day operation. They had clearly made an effort with this by providing images and sometimes videos with interviews and case studies. 

So this blog will parallel my time in grad school. One of the major domains we'd like to cover with this blog is learning something isn't a neat and tidy topic, but is actually a real-world complex and evolving system much like the world of research. In other words, learning not "programming language syntax" but computational thinking, programming methodologies, and frequently changing code updates and dependencies. By understanding these systems, we can also have the power to change them to work better automatically. In other words, by designing the world better, we can avoid redundant, boring education and spend more time focusing on the most challenging and exciting problems. But to get there we'll have to do some good old fashioned learning. 

## Productivity guide

One of my first examples of this kind of learning that I talked about in the first post. This guide intends to teach you how to design your own life for greater productivity by understanding the systems that govern your attention and energy. 

## Why Codecademy works

* Interleaving example and exercise
* Feedback
* Getting started right away

Ways to make it even better:

* Let users track which skills they've learned. And no I don't mean badges!
* Introduce spaced repetition
* (Exploration?)

## Finnish schools

If we can point out something interesting from the article... http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Why-Are-Finlands-Schools-Successful.html

## LifeHacking: n-back games to improve fluid intelligence

Neal: I’m thinking about doing this as a “scientific” lifehacking experiment... 

Ryan: Why just in-quotes-scientific? It was verified by experiment and published. The results were reproduced. If that's not science...

## Productivity guide

Getting pretty massive, so I will probably just link to it.

## Why philosophy of learning

* guide what questions to ask science, fit pieces together
* examine some general arguments against philosophy (reality is too counterintuitive?)

## Examining statement at end of Sweller paper 

All novel problem solving is means-end analysis.

## Breaking a 10yo habit in 10 minutes

## Peeling hard-boiled eggs

* patience
* fear
* local maximum
* insights

## "Thinking outside the box"

What does this common saying mean and how can we actually do it.

## which heuristics and general techniques are effective

The psychological question is when skills transfer. Studies have found that knowing the solution to one problem did not generalize to a "problem isotope". But this is different from abstract skills being applied in a particular case.  How effective is teaching abstract thinking? Seems like a problem is that people aren't able to make analogies to real-life knowledge. However, by learning the most abstract level, it may be easier to go to the abstract model rather than a more realistic one. However, e.g., mathematicians are sometimes supposedly bad at working with real problems.

"cognition machine" project

## Constructionism debate

hard to argue with theme of Lockhart or Papert

## Calculus of time management

When is it worth doing "2x faster" -- does it add up or is it trivial compared to the amount of downtime we'll have anyway

## Shifts in perspective

Modern monetary theory/other economics stuff

## Learning complex systems

* Dieting
* Economics

* Ashok Goel http://home.cc.gatech.edu/dil/3
* Donna Meadows

## Creativity

First mastering the fundamentals, then doing something crazy, sometimes seemingly simple (modern art)

Einstein hiding sources quote

## My Chinese quote

While my first post intends to cover methodology and goals of our style of learning, this one really describes the experience of that process. 

* Is categorical shift related?
* Is this process actually a good strategy that helps rewrite old theories?

## Learning categories

* Language/many facts (foreign language, business)
* Language w/ logical patterns (math)
* Technique (sports, music)

Most topics will cover many categories, but the primary work will often be in one

## Self-explanation

Arnov?

## Creativity vs. knowledge

Example: my creative way of doing double sine

## Individualization

* How is it effective
* How to combine with traditional classroom

## Test-driven learning 

No, not those kinds of tests!!

# Recurring features

## Learning log

kinda like GosuGuides but personal examples, not as strict format

## First step

also like GosuGuides but we just provide the (sometimes unexpected!) very first step to diving into something new

...notice a pattern here?

# Background reading

* lesswrong
* general philosophy
* eastern philosophy (zen of learning? tao of learning?)
