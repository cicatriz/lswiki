More will obviously follow; just wanted to get a stub going with some feedback from Luke.

# UI

* User has to know what their expected interaction is. On a related note, we need a better way to communicate the site's purpose and expected use patterns.
* Need a constant grid-structure layout. The contents of different grid elements can change, obviously, but it jars the user to see the layout continually shifting. We're definitely working in this direction, but something to consider for future layout choices.

In terms of the grid, we should think about some rules-- ie, "menus of type X always appear in the upper left corner," or "Content/information always appears in the center," etc.

Some ideas:

* Perhaps only display notes in the sidebar, and then have a |+| button --> "2 cards" or something where they could expand out to see the cards located there. Otherwise, the sidebar gets cluttered, and when viewing a document you really care more about the notes than the cards (which are studied in a different interface).

# Social

Lesson from social networks. The reason they work is 

1. they're addictive and we need to match this energy as best we can; 
2. they're invasive-- they send email updates, talked about constantly outside of online interactions, enable voyueristic look into your friends lives, etc. 
3. they're real-time. That is, they have feeds, updates, etc., and information is constantly changing and being updated. This draws you back in!

# General questions

How do you control the flow of information to be most meaningful?

Facebook is all about overload of information; there is no way you'll be able to see everything your friends are doing, and information is presented in a fire-hydrant news feed.

Twitter is much the same-- continual flow of information; you sort out who you want to follow, but still there can be overload in what is coming at you (especially if you don't check in for a day or two)

Learnstream is .... ? LS is more about how to make the vast amounts of available information reserved and memorable, focused not *fragmented. While more just buzz-words than a focused strategy, there's some precedent.

The balancing act is that if we need information, it is often a quick google search away. But, many sources "discovered" by google are fragmented, incomplete, not exactly what we want, etc.

We want to make the information coherent-- have courses with exhaustive lectures, exercises to reinforce and encourage understanding, social layer to get clarification and explain to others for your own clarification/benefit.

# Thoughts

I'm repeatedly dismayed by the ratio of time I spend browsing shit online (wikipedia, blogs, etc.) to the amount of stuff I actually remember. From a high level, all of those hours are completely wasted (or have to be tallied as entertainment-only), because I'm unable to remember anything I read. Similarly, it's disturbing to think back to classes you took freshman, sophomore, junior year and try to remember exactly what you learned in them... do you remember much of it? I feel that if we don't make the effort to remember what we learn, there's really no point in learning it in the first place. Of course, that's not how school functions, but perhaps it's something to aspire to.
