> I think that question is worth sitting on and thinking about seriously (which I know Ryan has been doing, and I've been trying to do with limited success). Specifically, what does the ideal social learning interaction look like, and how can that be done online?

> One model is the university, and it's been around for a long time. It's a community of scholars and learners, and knowledge is built and transmitted via conversation, collaboration, and lecture. It is also heirarchical, with professors acting like moderators. 

> Is this something to replicate, in some degree or other, with a modern technology twist? Or is this just a local maximum, and some other model is out there waiting to be discovered and developed?

> How can you create a self-sustaining community of learning and knowledge creation online? And is there any reason to separate out the learning from knowlege generation? Ie, is there anything intrinsically different between what we're trying to do (or the khan academy) and what, say, Terrence tau is doing with polymath projects? Can we create a platform that captures all of that?

> I have no frickin' idea how to answer any of those questions, but writing them down often helps me focus my thoughts. 

Ryan: 

> Don't know if anyone has seen this, where I've tried to start building up a theoretical basis: http://beta.learnstream.org/doc/137/ I discuss a bit the parallels of creating and learning.
> I've also listed questions whose answering may lead us towards a good model for online learning: http://beta.learnstream.org/doc/90/
 
> Here are some quick scattered thoughts on academic inspiration:
 
> Lectures: University lectures are not really collaborative. Most lectures, I assume, inherit from a textbook and/or a course that the instructor took, maybe a combination of a few sources. There is not really a good enough cross-breeding to evolve the lectures much. Nor is there usually survival except in what was remembered by the attendees. Also, from my experience, discussion in lectures is pretty weak. 
 
> Textbooks: It'd certainly be unusual to find a textbook with no exercises. But these exercises are usually really slow and difficult, they come from insights of the author and so maybe skip a step necessary to really learn something. Big Algs is pretty interesting because Prof. Ran is basing a lot of stuff on papers and not established textbooks. He is able to generate challenging and thought-provoking assignments but I'm not sure *exactly* what they are helping us learn. It does make us more familiar with the material which is actually a huge thing (first line of Suzuki's book, and basically all of AJATT condensed into one line: "Oh--why, Japanese children can all speak Japanese"). But some of the things have seem to be trying to use things in a totally backwards way of how they would have been discovered. And similarly it seems a lot of the way that we get through difficult problems at Mudd is to be handed a hint that includes what seems like brilliant insight.
 
> Conferences: The problem with conferences is that there seems to be a problem of matching background knowledge with the content of the talk. 
 
> Journals: The idea of peer-review seems to be a good system for eliminating noise for signal -- not all of it, certainly. The problem is that it is quite slow. Here is one new idea: http://f1000.com/ One of the ideas for Learnstream is matching up one person's question as another's exercise. Machines can help a bit with the spam and we could possibly reduce this to a very light and fast system. 
 
> How about this very conservation? It would be good to break down the ideas as questions and construct answers over time through conversations, pulling in more examples (which change over time), making metaphors, etc.
