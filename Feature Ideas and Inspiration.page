Check out the jigsaw collaborative learning technique http://www.jigsaw.org/ Loosely inspired by that is a small group environment where one person teaches some material to the other. Or where students compete to answer a card. These groups could be formed by grouping online users with similar sets cards due for review. (I'm imagining an interface like online games that occur in small rooms)

Card acquisition (and essentially all studying) is on auto-pilot. An initial set of cards is given to the user upon entering the course (and this may include something like "Read Chapter 1"). The database keeps track of conceptual dependencies. When these dependencies are satisfied, the user is alerted that new cards have been added to her deck. These cards will eventually be seen by the user, and at that point she can choose to remove the card or study it. (In the business model, these cards may sync to content that has not been purchased yet)

Twitter API: a fast way to add things to LS while sharing them with your usual workflow. You can opt-in to either import all of your tweets or you can tag them with @learnbot. These will be imported into an "imported items" course (unless you match a hashtag to a course name) as cards.

## Game-like features

Quora is huge right now, and it seems to do a great job with the question and answer features. See what we can steal, or what would be a good opportunity for integration. No API yet :/

StackOverflow (the other stackexchange sites) are growing quickly and have a great structure of social features for, essentially, getting questions answered. They now have a read-only API that would allow us to view questions and answers in our site. (Such as using this http://stackapps.com/questions/518/stacktack-a-javascript-widget-you-can-stick-anywhere) Here's more info: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/stack-exchange-api-public-beta-starts/ An ideal way I picture this is that we have a full integration with the question & answer features and user base, but these questions can be based around video and external documents via syncing and the questions are, of course, in the SRS. The would probably require capturing the interest of the founders...

Use APIs for pulling in content (and even features). These can be activated by special tags. Examples: #define:生词 could query a dictionary, Wolfram Alpha for interactive math applets, etc. (these are on Wave somewhere) See more on Mathematica as an immersive environment: http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/customer-stories/teaching-real-world-problems-with-mathematica.html

Wave integration ideas:

* bot for SRS interaction
* aggregate content on site for instructors and students through wave 
* use wave for documents, select sections to convert to SRS
* students use playback to see graders comments
* instructors use playback to grade collaborations
* collaboratively take notes during lecture
* parse LaTeX etc with bots
* use bots for interactive educational things (make graphs, educational games, etc)
* use bots to assist in problem solving (wavealpha, etc)

Vague feature idea: Old philosophy was "everything is a chunk", but this is bad for people's general preference to read and produce things in document form. Now we have documents that require chunks built on top. Maybe a compromise is to have appends/diffs. Documents can have explicit sections, then someone could have an additional idea to insert into it, or a clarification. Each of those things can be thought of as chunks (study-able, etc) and perhaps an extra benefit is that users can learn something more profound via the act of building up, removing, and clarifying things. They can even accept or reject certain diffs to make a customized course (shareable of course). No more sync problems because the syncs are the chunks! (Could also handle multi-step problems, figure out who did what in a collaboration, reconstruct a conversation, etc.)

An easy way to use a "list-centric" document. This one is a good example that would benefit -- basically the document will consist of a bunch of appended, fairly disjoint items, and there should be cards pointing to each of these.
