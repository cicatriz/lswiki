# Student-created course

The instructor may provide a short video to motivate the section. Students are assigned into teams to complete parts of the section by finding video and text sources, recording their own video, creating questions for the class, etc. The other students can then ask questions and add ideas to the produced document. Finally, the instructor can offer a concluding video and designate some cards as Concept Cards (Some of these will be simple reviews; others may be deeper questions that are answered later in the course. Either way, they're all in the SRS!)

# Teach-to-learn

The instructor provides an initial set of progressive questions whose answers constitute a good understanding of the subject. Students are responsible for researching and answering questions in a highly expository way. The instructor can periodically check in to make sure progress is going well. Grade is based on the points given for being helpful!

# The Dilettante

Once a lot of content is available, it'd be quite easy to scan through documents and add anything that might be of interest to SRS. E.g. ooh, compound interest is good to know *add card* this physics equation is pretty cool, I might want to hear Khan explain it some day *add card*
