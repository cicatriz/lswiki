Despite the shortcomings of the educational system, a large portion of the learning in most people’s lives occurs during their formal schooling.  What equips a high school or university to impart knowledge that students are unable to acquire on their own?  While there is something to be said for the knowledge of the instructors, I would argue that the primary benefit of most schools to most people is the consistent motivation from grades and the benefits of a fixed learning schedule.  For many people, the prospect of receiving a grade is a powerful motivator and regular deadlines force a basic minimum work ethic.  While learning this way may not be particularly efficient, it encourages students to rise to a basic standard that many would fail to reach on their own.

Unfortunately, the motivation arising from an artificial schedule of “semesters” or “terms” also comes at a cost. For example, an exam only tests a student’s knowledge at a specific point in time, measuring only temporary knowledge, not useful, lifetime knowledge.  Students take advantage of this by cramming for their exams so they can pass their classes, but promptly forget everything they learned the next morning.  Think of a class you took yourself four or five years ago…do you remember much of what you learned?  Perhaps you remember some broad themes, but if you are like most people, you remember very little of what you learned back then.

To most of the readers of this blog, this “learning to forget” style of education (hopefully) has little appeal.  Our goal is to become lifelong learners, which means continuing to learn throughout life and remembering what we learn. In order to accomplish this, we have to review current knowledge while we acquire new skills.  We benefit from doing this for a number of reasons:

It is much harder to acquire new information than to review old information.  In this way the learning to forget style of learning is incredibly inefficient as all the learning we do is the most difficult type of learning, learning new things.  Our techniques allows us to acquire more usable, lifelong knowledge.
Knowledge builds upon other knowledge.  Learning new skills often requires remembering previously learned skills.  By constantly reviewing fundamental skills, we make the process of learning new skills more efficient.
Less stressful, more balanced learning. The learning to forget style of learning forces periods of great stress.  Reviewing as you go allows for a smoother learning experience, and you ultimately end up more confident about your understanding of a concept.
Spaced repetition systems (SRS) represent a proven method for remembering past skills by reviewing as you learn. There are several software implementations of SRS, such as the one on Learnstream or an independent system such as Anki or SuperMemo.  An SRS is essentially an advanced flashcard system, where you progress through a series of cards, looking at questions on the front and guessing answers on the back.  The difference from most flashcard systems is that every time you guess an answer, you rate how difficult the question was when you look at the answer.  Based on your response and your history with the question, the SRS will automatically schedule you to study it again when you are most likely to start forgetting the material.  Questions you miss or find difficult will be rescheduled soon while easier ones will be scheduled further in the future.

Studying with an SRS is a great way to review old concepts while you learn new ones.  When you put new cards in an SRS deck to learn new material you will see them frequently at first, but see them less and less often as you become more familiar with them.  Once you are familiar with all of the cards in the course, you will still get reviews for the course to remind you of the concepts, but few enough so that the load is reasonable.  Additionally, by scheduling sessions every day, and SRS will promote consistent study habits without devoting too much or too little time to studying. Consistently reviewing cards will make your learning much more efficient, saving time and increasing retention in the long run.

If you haven’t already, check us out at Learnstream.  Not only do we have an SRS for you to try, but we have a suite of other tools and a platform for collaborating on educational content.  So, the next time you learn a skill that you actually want to remember, join our community and take that first step towards becoming a lifelong learner.

# Rewrite: How School Fails Passionate Students

About a year ago I decided I wanted to learn Japanese.  I’ve always wanted to learn another language, and ethnically I’m Japanese, so it made sense for me.  Furthermore, I had taken three years of high school Japanese about three years before, so I thought I was already well on my way to becoming proficient.  I got in contact with one of the Japanese professors on campus and arranged to take a placement test to see where I would fit into the sequence here.  I knew I wasn’t going to get three years of credit since high school is much easier than college and it had been two years since I had practiced it seriously.  However, I was shocked to the discover that my knowledge of Japanese warranted no placement at all.

That’s right, despite three years of study, by falling out of practice for a couple of years I no longer had any functional knowledge of the language.

Recently, I’ve been thinking about how I could have so little ability after such a long amount of study.
