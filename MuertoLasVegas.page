When a demon opens a new casino in Las Vegas, he realizes that even __he__ has lessons to learn about sin as he competes for the souls of whores, gamblers, and other degenerates.

Ok, we weren’t actually going for a wacky sitcom about a demon-baron’s struggles, but I guess that’s one possibility. Also I feel like I need to read Fear & Loathing to be qualified to write about Vegas.

Actually that has more legs than our original idea. A hopelessly out of touch demon is resurrected from his imprisonment of however many years to find the world has changed. Still, full of optimism and unnatural spunk he manages to open a new casino using some of his remaining reserves of magical power; however, it proves more than he bargained for! He recruits an eclectic mix personalities to help him in running his venture. Maybe with their help he’ll finally get the Most Valued Employee award from his boss! And the parking spot that goes with it!
