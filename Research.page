# Overview

collaborative research using web resources, social networks, and other computational tools with a focus on individual learning throughout the process (progress in research won't be made without people understanding the basics)

example domains: math/science research, starcraft 2 (players collaboratively "research" new build orders, tactics, etc. and then apply this knowledge to improving their ability), poker, chess, or other fields with a large web presence and eagerness for mastery

# Topics

## Spread of knowledge on a social network

like Facebook but going for *useful* knowledge -- how can current array of tools (Twitter, blogs, FB/G+) be improved?

* scientific questions: relative quickness of ideas spreading?
* computational tools: improvements to social aspects of LS soup
* cognitive aspects: deciding to share something, deciding to pay attention to something

## Tying learning tools into collaborative research

how to peel off the things that need practice and/or memorization? (e.g. definitions can be memorized effectively with SRS); how does knowledge from the collaboration transfer to learning

* scientific questions: do generic practices work as well for topic X as for topic Y? 
* computational tools: LS Glue
* cognitive aspects: 

## Collaborative problem solving

investigate and improve upon efforts like polymath, optimize allocation of effort, improve motivation 

* scientific questions: 
* tools: improve on polymath
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of on-going activity, motivation

## Web video

* scientific questions: is using video to learn effective?
* tools: along the lines of Learnstream
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of video content

## Scaffolded problem solving

* scientific questions: does it work?
* tools: extending quiz-embedded videos in LS Atomic
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of problem 

## Spaced repetition for learning

explore how to use spaced repetition for more than just simple facts

* cognitive aspects: what is the basis for the effectiveness of "triggering" (if this really exists)?

(look at some other lists -- LS minis, etc. where did i discuss DSL?)
