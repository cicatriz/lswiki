# Overview

Our research involves enhancing collaborative learning and research through web resources, social networks, and other computational tools with a particular interest in domains where the knowledge base is rapidly changing so that research results directly impact learning goals. 

Examples: 

* In math or science research, new results need to be evaluated and, if they are determined valid, assimilated into the knowledge of researchers. Currently, the evaluation process is primarily done through peer-review journals, and new results are presented at conferences. However, much interest has been shown in creating a faster method of publishing, using blogs and social networks to spread new results, etc.
* In the strategy game Starcraft 2, players research new strategies and practices (primarily using the web). Players must continually learn these new ideas to stay on top of the game as it evolves.
* Programmers must constantly learn new languages and tools and update their existing knowledge when software, hardware, and other factors are updated. 


# Topics

## Spread of knowledge on a social network

like Facebook but going for *useful* knowledge -- how can current array of tools (Twitter, blogs, FB/G+) be improved?

* scientific questions: relative quickness of ideas spreading?
* computational tools: improvements to social aspects of LS soup
* cognitive aspects: deciding to share something, deciding to pay attention to something

## Tying learning tools into collaborative research

how to peel off the things that need practice and/or memorization? (e.g. definitions can be memorized effectively with SRS); how does knowledge from the collaboration transfer to learning

* scientific questions: do generic practices work as well for topic X as for topic Y? 
* computational tools: LS Glue
* cognitive aspects: 

## Collaborative problem solving

investigate and improve upon efforts like polymath, optimize allocation of effort, improve motivation 

* scientific questions: 
* tools: improve on polymath
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of on-going activity, motivation

## Web video

* scientific questions: is using video to learn effective?
* tools: along the lines of Learnstream
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of video content

## Scaffolded problem solving

* scientific questions: does it work?
* tools: extending quiz-embedded videos in LS Atomic
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of problem 

## Spaced repetition for learning

explore how to use spaced repetition for more than just simple facts

* cognitive aspects: what is the basis for the effectiveness of "triggering" (if this really exists)?

## Storing educational material 

One foundational aspect of all of these topics is how the underlying knowledge content is stored. Can we improve the efficiency of various tools by finding a better way to represent the information? Some ideas: breaking up a topic into knowledge components expressed as questions, creating a DSL that allows ideas to be stored as variables and procedures (Also, think about implications of having educational material in a procedural form -- like in Mindstorms, it could be used for simulations to build intuition)

* tools: tool for creating a database of knowledge content, tool for retrieving information from the database
